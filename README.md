# Matrices_AndreSaldanha

This is my semester project for CS131: Discrete Structures.

In my presentation, I introduce what matrices are and the operations that can be performed on them. Then in my code, I show how I used matrices to encrypt messages. Finally, I show how I manipulated images using matrices, also part of my code.
